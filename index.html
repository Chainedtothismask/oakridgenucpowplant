      <h2>Welcome to the Team</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the team, your first shift starts tomorrow morning! We're short-staffed, but I'm sure you and your big brain can figure it out!</p>
      <p>Be responsible for overseeing a multi-billion-dollar operation, one of the planet's most potent and delicate energy systems. Every decision matters, from regulating the reactor's behaviour, running turbines, managing cooling systems, maintaining pumps and valves, to responding to emergencies, all while maintaining strict safety protocols.</p>
      <p>At Koyot Digital, we simulate a hypothetical Western RBMK-1500 reactor. The game strikes a balance between realism and accessibility. Meet demand, and enjoy your nuclear operator journey!</p>
      <p><em>We hope to see you in the game very soon!</em></p>
