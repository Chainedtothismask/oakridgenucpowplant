# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions from developers of all experience levels.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you have:
- [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine
- A GitHub account
- Basic familiarity with CLI, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** by clicking the "Fork" button on the GitHub repository page

2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

3. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Making Changes

### Code Guidelines

- Focus on content changes rather than major layout redesigns unless discussed in an issue first
- When editing HTML files like `index.html`, make changes within existing `<section>` tags
- Ensure your code follows proper HTML structure and validation
- Test your changes on both desktop and mobile devices
- Keep changes focused - one feature or fix per pull request

### Commit Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g. "thing" or "stuff" won't cut it)
- Start commit messages with a verb in present tense (e.g., "add:", "fix:", "edit:")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters when possible
- Example good commit messages:
    - "fix: typo in about section"
    - "add: mobile responsiveness to navigation"
    - "edit: contact information"

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting your pull request:
- [ ] Verify all links work correctly
- [ ] Test on both desktop and mobile viewports
- [ ] Validate HTML markup
- [ ] Check for spelling and grammar errors
- [ ] Ensure no layout breaks or visual regressions

## Submitting Your Contribution

1. **Stage and commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```

2. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request**:
    - Navigate to your fork on GitHub
    - Click "Compare & Pull Request"
    - Fill out the PR template with:
        - **Title**: Clear, specific description of what you changed
        - **Description**: Explain what you changed, why you changed it, and any potential impacts

## Pull Request Guidelines
